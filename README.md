# HandyNotes_HallowsEnd
HandyNotes - Hallow's End (Backport for WotLK 3.3.5)  
This is a backport of the original HandyNotes Hallow's End plugin.
It has been completely rewritten and optimized to work properly with Wrath of the Lich King 3.3.5 private servers.  

Marks the locations of candy buckets on the world map and minimap.
If you also have TomTom installed, you can right-click on a marker to create a waypoint arrow.  
Requires [HandyNotes](https://www.wowace.com/projects/handynotes/files/409743) to work.


You can customize the addon via the HandyNotes options menu:
- Icon size (scale)  
- Icon transparency (alpha)  
- Show all icons, even if you have already visited the candy buckets
